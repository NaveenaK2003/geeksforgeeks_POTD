Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Examples :

Input: LinkedList : 1->2->3->4->5

Output: 5
Explanation: Count of nodes in the linked list is 5, which is its length.


Solution:


class Solution {
    // Function to count nodes of a linked list.
    public int getCount(Node head) {
        // code here
        if(head==null){
            return 0;
        }
        int count=0;
        while(head!=null){
            count++;
            head=head.next;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
